The [National Hockey League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League){:target="_blank"} [(NHL)](http://www.nhl.com){:target="_blank"} was created in 1917 as a result of a feud between executives of the [National Hockey Association](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_Association){:target="_blank"} (NHA). Due to the times (see [Great Depression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression){:target="_blank"} / [World War II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II){:target="_blank"}) and competition from two other major hockey leagues ([Pacific Coast Hockey Association](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Coast_Hockey_Association){:target="_blank"} & [Western Canada Hockey League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Canada_Hockey_League){:target="_blank"}), the NHL was not guaranteed success.

[The Stanley Cup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup){:target="_blank"} has been awarded to the champion of the NHL since 1927. Between 1927 and 1942 teams came and went but the ["Original Six"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_Six){:target="_blank"} ([Montreal Canadiens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Canadiens){:target="_blank"}, [Toronto Maple Leafs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs){:target="_blank"}, [Boston Bruins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins){:target="_blank"}, [Chicago Blackhawks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Blackhawks){:target="_blank"}, [Detroit Red Wings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Red_Wings){:target="_blank"}, & [New York Rangers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Rangers){:target="_blank"}) remain to this day. Between 1942 and 1967 no expansions took place in the NHL, leaving the Original Six to compete for the Stanley Cup for 26 seasons. But in 1966 six new franchises were awarded and joined the NHL for the 1967 season. The teams were the [Los Angeles Kings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Kings){:target="_blank"}, [Minnesota North Stars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_North_Stars){:target="_blank"}, [Philadelphia Flyers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Flyers){:target="_blank"}, [Pittsburgh Penguins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins){:target="_blank"}, [Oakland Seals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Seals){:target="_blank"}, and [St. Louis Blues](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Blues){:target="_blank"}.

During [the Expansion era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_National_Hockey_League_(1967-92)){:target="_blank"} between 1967 and 1992, the league grew to 22 teams, the [Buffalo Sabres](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Sabres){:target="_blank"} and [Vancouver Canucks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_Canucks){:target="_blank"} joined the league in 1970, and four more teams ([Edmonton Oilers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers){:target="_blank"}, [Hartford Whalers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartford_Whalers){:target="_blank"}, [Quebec Nordiques](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_Nordiques){:target="_blank"}, & [Winnipeg Jets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg_Jets_(1972-96)){:target="_blank"} were absorbed into the NHL when the [World Hockey Association](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Hockey_Association){:target="_blank"} folded in 1979. During the 1970's violence in hockey was punctuated by a style of play most notoriously epitomized by the [Broad Street Bullies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Flyers#1972.E2.80.9378){:target="_blank"}. On a side note there is a fictionalized depiction of this style of hockey in the movie [Slap Shot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slap_Shot_(film)){:target="_blank"}, I recommend that you [check it out](https://www.amazon.com/Slap-Shot-Paul-Newman/dp/B002H22MCS/){:target="_blank"}.

[The Modern Era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_National_Hockey_League_(1992-present)){:target="_blank"} between 1992 and the present has been a trying time. There have been four lockouts, beginning in 1992 there was a Labor strike but it was short lived. The next lockout in 1994-1995 lasted much longer and cut the season in half. During this time several small market Canadian teams had to relocate due to the falling value of the Canadian dollar and doing business in American dollars while taking revenue in Canadian dollars. The [Winnipeg Jets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg_Jets_(1972-96)#Demise_and_relocation){:target="_blank"} became the [Phoenix Coyotes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Coyotes){:target="_blank"}, the [Quebec Nordiques](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_Nordiques){:target="_blank"} became the [Colorado Avalanche](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche){:target="_blank"}, and the [Hartford Whalers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartford_Whalers){:target="_blank"} became the [Carolina Hurricanes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Hurricanes){:target="_blank"}. The next lockout came 10 years later, when the previous [collective bargaining agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHL_Collective_Bargaining_Agreement){:target="_blank"} from 1994 expired, making 2004 the first time in North American history a labor dispute led to [the cancellation of an entire season](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004-05_NHL_lockout){:target="_blank"}, no games were played. Many pros from the NHL played in Europe that season. The 2012-2013 lockout was similar to the 1994-1995 lockout in that it resulted in an abbreviated season with each team only playing 48 games.

In 2005 the two-line pass was eliminated and a zero tolerance policy on obstruction penalties was implemented (some argue this has increased diving). At first these rule changes increased scoring but as of the 2007-2008 season scoring has reverted back to pre-lockout totals. I still believe the current state of the game is better than it has ever been. Some believe that the current point system should be changed by eliminating the overtime loss statistic and to no longer award teams a point for an overtime or shootout loss.
